Creates GPT instance that just works everywhere JavaScript works ðŸ¤–

No dependencies. <2KB. Try now.

-----

## Introduction

"anything-gpt" is a minimalist, highly portable JavaScript package designed to integrate OpenAI's GPT models into any JavaScript environment.

From running in a browser's console to executing in AWS Lambda functions, "anything-gpt" stands out for its zero-dependency architecture and lightweight footprint, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of applications.

For more information check out the [documentation](https://the-dgt.github.io/anything-gpt/).

## Features

- **Universal JavaScript Compatibility**: Works seamlessly in any JS environment (browsers, Node.js, AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers, etc.).
- **Zero Dependencies**: No external dependencies, ensuring easy integration and minimal conflicts.
- **Ultra-Lightweight**: Less than 2KB in size, making it incredibly efficient and fast to load.
- **Simple Interface**: Offers a straightforward way to send network requests to OpenAI and handle text or stream responses.
- **Stream & Text Response Handling**: Supports both streaming and traditional text responses, giving you flexibility in how you receive data.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling for robust and reliable performance.

## Installation

```bash
npm install anything-gpt
```
or
```bash
yarn add anything-gpt
```

## Usage

```ts
import {
  core,
  chunkify,
  useOptions,
  useEnvironment,
  ChatMessage, // everything is typed already,
  CreateInstanceOptions, // but you can also import types 
  AbstractEnvironmentContext, // to use them anywhere in your code
} from "anything-gpt"

// Let's create GPT instance that would work for client-side application.
// Our goal now is to just log the streamed response from ChatGPT's Completions Chat API
// right to the browser's console. 

// First step is to set the ChatGPT's Completions Chat API options
// and provide OpenAI API key.
const options: CreateInstanceOptions = {
  gpt: {
    // these fields are set by default, override them if needed.
    // model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    // temperature: 0.7,
    // max_tokens: 4000,
    // stream: true,
    model: "gpt-4" 
  }, 
  instance: {
    // you define where the key comes from, depending on JS environment you work with.
    api_key: localStorage.getItem("your_api_key_here")
  }, 
}

// Second step is to set up the environment handlers,
const browser: Partial<AbstractEnvironmentContext> = {
  stream: async (response: Response) => // handle streamed response as is,
    chunkify(response, (chunk: string) => console.log(chunk)), // or use built-in helper for getting message by chunk
}

// Last step is to create "gpt" function. 
// "useEnvironment" and "useOptions" are simple adapter functions those just applied default values 
// and returns 100% correct required interface
const gpt = core.bind(
  useEnvironment(browser), // create context for anything, say, for "game-engine", "cli-terminal", "cloudfalre-worker", etc.
  useOptions(options),
)

declare const anything: string | number | object | any[] | Function | Error // and so on

// That's it! Use tagged "gpt" function as you want!
const conversation: ChatMessage[] = await gpt`enter you prompt. you can also pass ${anything} here`
```
